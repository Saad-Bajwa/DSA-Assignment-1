Single Linked List:
    In a singly linked list, each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence.
    The last node's pointer points to null, indicating the end of the list.
    Traversal is only possible in one direction, starting from the head node and following the next pointers.

Doubly Linked List:
    In a doubly linked list, each node contains data and two pointer/reference to the next and previous node in the sequence.
    The last node's next pointer points to null and the first node's previous pointer points to null, indicating the end and start of the list.
    Traversal is possible in both direction, starting from the head node and starting from the tail node, following the next pointers.

Cicular Linked List:
    In a circular linked list, the last node's pointer does not point to null; instead, it points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
    Traversal in a circular linked list is possible starting from any node, and it can traverse the entire list by following the next pointers until reaching the starting node again.
