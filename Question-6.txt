Pros of the Linked List :
Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size during runtime since they use dynamic memory allocation. This makes them suitable for applications where the size of the data structure is unknown or fluctuates frequently.

Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations are efficient in linked lists, especially for singly linked lists when performed at the beginning or end of the list. They can be done in constant time O(1) if the position is known.

Memory Utilization: Linked lists can utilize memory more efficiently than arrays, as they only allocate memory when necessary, unlike arrays which need contiguous memory allocation at the time of creation.

No Memory Wastage: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not suffer from memory wastage due to unused or empty slots, as each node only allocates memory for the data it holds and the reference to the next node.

Cons of the Linked List :
Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support random access to elements. Accessing an element in a linked list requires traversing the list from the beginning, which can be inefficient for large lists, resulting in linear time complexity O(n).

Extra Memory Usage: Linked lists require extra memory for storing references to the next node, which can result in higher memory consumption compared to arrays, especially in scenarios where a large number of small nodes are used.
Sequential Access Only: Linked lists are suitable for sequential access, but not for applications that require frequent random access or searching, as these operations are less efficient compared to arrays.

More Complex Operations: Some operations on linked lists, such as reversing the list or finding the kth element from the end, can be more complex and require more computational overhead compared to similar operations on arrays.
